```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(car)

carPrice <- read_csv("C:/Users/Cody/Documents/College/10th semester (fall 2021)/Math 425 (linear Regression)/Cars Data (GLS VW passat).csv")
View(carPrice)
rows <- c(1:55,57:58)
carPrice <- carPrice[rows,] 
carPrice[-(23),]
```

## Background


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
